ASSUMPTIONS:
The assumptions made were based in the specification and also extracted from the Webgrader, which helped a lot. 
While it gave incorrect outputs, this was useful in order to understand some rules that were not clear in the specification.

After have run the Webgrader I could notice that some syntax error msg had the following template: 'errToken', but others had 'errToken '. 
Then, the driver file considers these two different inputs. 

SOURCE:
During the development of this project it was necessary to consult different sources of information. They are the following:
- http://www.antlr.org
	Main resource that provided the greater part of needed information to build the grammar.
- http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/
	As I was not used to java I needed to consult the API specification chart very often to learn new functions.
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6372960/catching-all-other-characters-in-antlr
	This topic inspired me with ideas to build my grammar in the part 1.
