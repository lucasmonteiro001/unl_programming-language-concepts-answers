ASSUMPTIONS:
The assumptions made were based in the specification and also extracted from the Webgrader, which helped a lot. 
While it gave incorrect outputs, this was useful in order to understand some rules that were not clear in the specification.

For phase 4, I assume that it will always be possible to find a chute or ladder while running the program. If it is not possible to find a ladder going forward and a chute going backward, probably the program will output a wrong answer. I also assume that there is no chute on the 
first position and that there is no ladder in the last position.

SOURCE:
During the development of this project it was necessary to consult different sources of information. They are the following:
- http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters
	This website was my starting point to practice Haskell. It did well while explaning the basis for the language.
- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Control_structures
	The wiki provided good information on how to work with Control Structures in Haskell.
