ASSUMPTIONS:
The assumptions made were based in the specification and also extracted from the Webgrader, which helped a lot. 
While it gave incorrect outputs, this was useful in order to understand some rules that were not clear in the specification.

It is assumed that the input will always be correct because there is no error handler.

Part 2, 3 and 4 were not implemented because I really had trouble trying to figure it out and so I couldn’t find any solution.

SOURCE:
During the development of this project it was necessary to consult different sources of information. They are the following:
- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Prolog
	This website was my starting point to practice Prolog. It did well while explaining the basis for the language.
- Slides and examples given in class
	They were probably the most valuable resource, where I could practice and learn more on how to address problems in Prolog.
